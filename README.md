Candidate_CodingCommunity_Contributions_RankingPrediction_Algorithm
- Scraping, aggregating and assessing technical ability of a candidate based on publicly available sources

Problem Statement
The current interview scenario is biased towards "candidate's performance during the 2 hour interview" and doesn't take other factors into account such as candidate's competitive coding abilities, contribution towards developer community and so on.

Approach
Candidate_CodingCommunity_Contributions_RankingPrediction_Algorithm tries to solve this problem by aggregating publicly available data from various websites such as

* Github
* StackOverflow
* CodeChef
* Codebuddy
* Codeforces
* Hackerearth
* SPOJ
* GitAwards
Once the data is collected, the algorithm then defines a comprehensive scoring system that grades the candidates technical capablities based on following factors

- Ranking
- Number of Problems Solved
- Activity
- Reputation
- Contribution
- Followers
The candidate is then assigned a scored out of 100 
This helps the interviewer get a full view of candidates abilties and therefore helps them make a unbiased, informed decision.
